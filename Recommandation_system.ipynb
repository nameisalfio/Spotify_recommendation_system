    "    <img src=\"static/emoji.png\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "A recommendation system is a software application or algorithm designed to suggest specific items to users, such as products, services, digital content, or information, based on their preferences, past behaviors, or individual profiles. These systems are widely used on platforms like Netflix, Amazon, Spotify, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary challenge these systems face is filtering through vast amounts of content (such as millions of tracks on Spotify) to provide users with only what truly interests them. Users interact with a set of items (in our case, music tracks), and the goal is to predict their preferences in order to highlight personalized recommendations that align with their tastes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are \"non-intelligent\" recommendation systems that are not tailored to specific user interests, such as lists of favorites, wishlists, top-10 rankings, or most popular items. On the other hand, there are customized recommendation systems based on user preferences, and Spotify's recommendation system falls into this advanced category.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Utility Function and Utility Matrix</h3><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Utility Function and User Scores**\n",
    "The process of predicting user preferences for a product is based on a **utility function**. This function determines a score representing the user's preference for the item in question. The objective is to predict this score for each user-item pair, allowing the system to evaluate the utility of the product for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Utility Matrix for Preference Analysis**\n",
    "The utility matrix is an essential tool for analyzing the preferences of multiple users. Columns represent items, while rows correspond to users. Each element at position (i,j) represents the rating indicating user i's preference for item j, obtained through the utility function. This matrix, often sparse, is used to predict missing ratings.\n",

    "**Key Challenges**\n",
    "• Populating the matrix (cold start problem) since data is needed for new users;<br>\n",
    "• Estimating missing ratings;<br>\n",
    "• Evaluating the recommendation system;<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Populating the Utility Matrix**\n",
    "The utility matrix can be populated explicitly or implicitly:\n",
    "- **Explicitly**: Requires users to rate items, but this approach is often ineffective due to low participation or user resistance. Incentives, such as financial rewards, may be necessary to encourage users to leave reviews.\n",
    "- **Implicitly**: Infers user preferences based on their behavior on the platform. However, assigning ratings to new items remains a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges with Extrapolating Utilities**\n",
    "- **Sparsity of the Matrix**: Not all users provide ratings for every item.\n",
    "- **New Items**: New objects may not have any assigned ratings.\n",
    "- **New Users**: Newly registered users may lack a rating history.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Content-Based vs Collaborative Filtering</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content-Based**: Recommends new items based on the content of items the user has interacted with.<br>\n",
    "**Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests new items based on the preferences of other users with similar tastes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Content-Based</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Used for recommending movies, websites, blogs, and news articles. A user who likes certain items is profiled by extracting information about those items. The system seeks a match with available products and recommends them to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "A content-based recommendation system suggests new objects to users based on the characteristics of objects they have previously interacted with. This approach is commonly used for recommending movies, websites, blogs, and news articles. To profile objects, features are manually or automatically extracted, such as author, title, keywords, or image tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Extraction**\n",
    "- **Manual**: Through APIs to obtain specific information.\n",
    "- **Automatic**: Using techniques like TF-IDF to extract important words or image tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Similarity Calculation**\n",
    "Movies, for example, are profiled using fixed-length feature vectors, which can be binary (0 and 1) or contain ratings from 0 to 5. Cosine similarity between feature vectors is used to calculate the similarity between items. The choice of scaling factor alpha affects the similarity measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Profiling**\n",
    "A user is profiled as an aggregate of the items they have shown interest in. The user vector is obtained using the same features as the items, calculating the average of the features of the items that caught the user's attention, summarizing all the features of the items the user has interacted with. An item whose vector has a high similarity measure to the user's vector is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- No need to know about other users to make recommendations.\n",
    "- Performs well even for users with very specific tastes.\n",
    "- Can recommend new items even if they haven't been rated by other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Manually finding the right features for items is difficult.\n",
    "- Profiling a new user without prior information is problematic.\n",
    "- Tends to specialize in the user's existing tastes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Collaborative Filtering</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Seeks similar users to recommend items that have been liked by similar users.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>User-User</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "In User-User Collaborative Filtering, the key idea is that similar users have similar preferences. Considering a user X, a set of N users with similar tastes to X is identified. Jaccard similarity, which returns a value between 0 and 1, is used to evaluate user similarity.\n",
    "\n",

    "\\text{Jaccard Similarity: } J(A, B) = \\frac{\\lvert A \\cap B \\rvert}{\\lvert A \\cup B \\rvert}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each user is profiled as an aggregate of the items they are interested in, resulting in a **set** for each user. Similarity measures between all pairs of sets (and thus between users) are evaluated using either **Jaccard similarity** or **cosine similarity**. However, using these metrics to evaluate set similarity can yield insignificant results, especially when a user assigns the same rating to all items.>\n",

    "$$r_x = \\{1, 0, 0, 1, 3\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Similar Users with Overlapping-Item Mean Centering**\n",
    "To address the issues mentioned above, the mean of each user's ratings is calculated, and this mean is subtracted from each rating in the matrix. This increases the disparity between cosine similarities obtained, nullifying values for users who assigned the same rating to all items.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating cosine similarity between users with mean centering becomes:\n",

    "- **$r_y$**: Rating of user $y$\n",
    "- **$\\bar{r}_x$**: Mean rating of user $x$\n",
    "- **$\\bar{r}_y$**: Mean rating of user $y$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach favors recommendations based only on items rated by both users, improving the relevance of recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Item-Item</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Item-Item Collaborative Filtering, the goal is to predict the score for an item I by finding similar items and evaluating the ratings users have assigned to those similar items. The approach is based on the concept that similar items receive similar ratings from users.\n",

    "- **$S_ij$**: Similarity between items i and j\n",
    "- **$r_xj$**: Rating of user X for item j\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure is similar to User-User Collaborative Filtering. The neighborhood of items (N) is calculated, the mean is subtracted from all elements of each item vector, and similarity values between all rows are computed. Only the k most similar items to the target item are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average of the scores that user X has given to the k items is calculated to predict the score that user X will give to item i. A weighted average is preferable, where the weight is determined by the similarity measure between the j-th item and the target item i.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Works well with various types of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- The matrix is sparse.\n",
    "- Cold start problems, especially when the matrix is empty.\n",
    "- Difficulty recommending items to users with very specific tastes (popularity bias).\n"

    "  <li><b>id</b>: The unique ID of the song.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>name</b>: The name of the song.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>valence</b>: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positivity conveyed by a song.</li>\n",

    "In the absence of a dataset, one needs to be created, which was done using Spotify's REST APIs. This will be discussed in more detail in the dedicated <a href=\"#data\">data section</a>. \n",
    "The recommendation system will be built in several phases. First, a Spotify App will be created, which will be used for authentication via OAuth. Once logged into a personal Spotify account, access to all user data will be granted.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<h3>Why Clustering?</h3>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The challenge arises from the need to evaluate the recommendation system. To do so, \"true labels\" are required as a benchmark for the predictions made by the system. In the absence of such data, it was created using a clustering algorithm to group songs with similar audio features into a single cluster. Each song was then labeled with the label of its corresponding cluster.\n",
    "A content-based system like this provides recommendations by analyzing the structure of items and tends to perform well, especially when user preferences are very specific. Given this strength of the system, the following assumption is made: all songs in a cluster reflect the tastes of a specific user.\n",
    "This strong assumption allows not only the acquisition of real labels (i.e., the user who likes the song) but also enables testing the system on users with specific tastes. This will be further discussed in the <a href='#results'>results section</a>.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<h3>PCA</h3>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "It was decided to perform PCA before clustering. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a highly relevant statistical technique in data analysis and machine learning. Its utility lies in its ability to reduce the complexity of a multivariate dataset, simplifying data representation without losing significant information.\n",
    "To represent items (songs) in a two-dimensional space, this type of analysis is used to select two significant components that allow the projection of data onto a plane without losing significant information.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<h3>How the Recommendation System Works</h3>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The input to the model consists of a list of songs considered \"liked\" or appreciated by a specific user. This list of songs represents the user's musical preferences and serves as an aggregated profile of their tastes.\n",
    "The recommendation system uses this list of songs as a starting point to identify other similar songs that the user might enjoy. By analyzing the musical characteristics of the songs in the user-provided list, the system creates an aggregated profile representing the user's preferences. This aggregated profile is then used to find songs in the broader catalog that are similar to the songs liked by the user.\n",
    "This comparison is performed using cosine distance, a similarity measure between vectors that considers the angle between them. Songs in the dataset are ranked based on their distance from the aggregated profile of the songs in the provided list. The most similar songs, i.e., those with the smallest distance, are selected as recommendations.\n",
    "Finally, the recommendations are returned to the user, providing a list of songs that are similar to those in the initial list. If the number of unique recommendations is less than the desired amount, additional songs are added until the required quantity is reached.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<h2>Why Is a System Like This Interesting?</h2>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "A recommendation system like the one described plays a fundamental role in various contexts for several reasons. First, it offers a level of user personalization that goes beyond simply providing a wide range of content. The ability to suggest songs based on individual user preferences enhances engagement and improves the listening experience.\n",
    "A key aspect of this personalization is the discovery of new content. Thanks to recommendation systems, users can be exposed to songs and artists they might never have encountered otherwise. This not only enriches their musical experience but also promotes diversity and exploration of musical genres that might otherwise be overlooked.\n",

    "During the dataset preparation phase for the Spotify recommendation system project, various online data sources were explored. Many ready-to-use and reliable datasets were available, but it was decided to build a dataset from scratch because we did not want to leverage the work of others. Additionally, building a dataset from scratch requires effort and dedication.\n",
    "To create the Spotify track dataset, several playlists on Spotify were subscribed to. \n",
    "To increase the <b>heterogeneity</b> of the available data, playlists containing tracks from different decades and with generally varied characteristics were selected. This ensures that the observed data are not overly specific to a single type of track and do not bias the predictions of the recommendation system. In this way, it is ensured that the recommendation system can provide accurate and diverse suggestions to the user.\n",
    "Subsequently, all tracks within the playlists were collected using the Spotify APIs.\n",
    "For each playlist (approximately 150) that the user added to their favorites, all tracks were extracted, specifically the ‘id’ and ‘name’, which represent the identifier and title of the track. Then, the Spotify APIs were used again to retrieve the features that could not be initially obtained, extracting them directly from the playlists.\n",
    "The concatenation of all tracks extracted in this manner resulted in the construction of the dataset “data.csv”, which can be found in the project directory “datasets/data.csv”. The decision to build the dataset from scratch unfortunately limits its size; the total amount of collected data amounts to approximately 24k records.\n",
